The Jingle License

The Jingle License is a combination of the MIT license and the GNU GPLv3 license.
It is, in most parts, the same as the MIT license except changes made to the
software itself must be made opensource under a pre-existing license if made
public, with the changes being clearly stated. This license was created to
provide a large amount of freedom to developers while still supporting opensource.
You are still allowed to change the license if you make public changes to the
software so you do not have to use The Jingle License if your changes are made opensource.
