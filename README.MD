## üìú About <a name = "about"></a>
Jingle is a dynamically-typed programming language currently in development. Code in Jingle is fast to run and compile while still retaining small source files and binaries. Based off the Crafting Interpreters book with a new syntax and expanded standard library. More base language features are coming soon.

Here is an example that calculates the Fibonacci numbers and times it to give you a quick look at the language:
```elixir
fn fib(n):
  if (n < 2) return n;
  return fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1);
end

var start = timer();
echo "How many iterations?";
var iter = num(gets());
echo "fib(" + str(iter) + ") = " + str(fib(iter));
echo "Time taken " + str(round(timer() - start, 2)) + "s";
```

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Tested in Visual Studio 2019 on Windows. Publish build to local folder and run from commandline: `jingle <filename>`
