## üìú About <a name = "about"></a>
Jingle is a multi-paradigm, gradually-typed programming language currently in development. It makes use of type inferrence and code in Jingle is fast to run and compile while still retaining small source files and binaries. It compiles to machine code via the LLVM using the LLVMlite library but it can also use its bytecode virtual machine to run files at slower speeds but without the need of the large LLVM dependency.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Installation:
  1. Clone project or download a release binary
  2. Install dependencies with `pip -r requirements.txt`
  
Compile to a native executable
  1. Run the following command `python3 -m compiler.compile <filename>`
  2. Run the generated executable

Generate LLVM bytecode
  1. Run the following command `python3 -m compiler.llvmgen <filename>`
  2. LLVM bytecode will be printed out

Execute in an LLVM JIT
  1. Run the following command `python3 -m compiler.run <filename>`
  2. Result will be printed

Execute a file on the virtual machine
  1. Run the following command `python3 -m compiler.vm <filename>`
  2. Result will be printed
