## What is Jingle?
Jingle is a (very) high-level general-purpose programming language based off of Java. It is statically-typed, inferred and nominal. *"So why would I use this instead of Java?"*, I hear you ask. Well, Jingle is written in almost plain English. This makes it much easier for beginners without adding complexity or removing functionality for advanced programmers. It is also targets the JVM.
## Examples
Alright, let's look at how this whole "written in English" thing works. Here are 2 Hello World applications written in both Java & Jingle, with Java being on top and Jingle being on bottom.

```java

public class HelloWorld {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello, World");
  }
  
}
```
```
say "Hello World"
```

As you can see, Jingle is a lot simpler and in this case, just makes more sense. Its syntax is more similar to scripting languages and lines that you would enter into a command prompt, rather than convoluted solutions to incredibly simple tasks.

## Getting Started
If you're raring to go and want to dive straight into Jingle, there are 2 ways that it can be used (with hopefully more in the future!)

Firstly the more usual and more reliable way is to add Jingle as a plugin to Eclipse.
The other way is to use an online IDE that supports Jingle.

I have other ways that I am planning to bring Jingle to as many programmers (and non-programmers too!) to as many people as possible. I am working on bringing [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) support to Jingle, which will allow it to be used in many other IDEs (examples: Visual Studio Code, Eclipse Che etc..).

After you have chosen how you would like to use Jingle, follow our Beginner's guide that teaches you how to install Jingle, the basics of the language & more!
