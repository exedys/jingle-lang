# Jingle

## What is Jingle?
Jingle is a (hopefully) general-purpose programming language created using Java & Xtext. It is a statically-typed, inferred, nominal programming language. *"So how is it different to Java? Just more syntax I have to learn?"*, I hear you ask. Well, Jingle is written in almost plain English. This makes it much easier for beginners without adding complexity or removing functionality for advanced programmers. It is also completely JVM compatible and Jingle code can be compiled to Java.
## Examples
Alright, let's look at how this whole "written in English" thing works. Here are 2 Hello World applications written in both Java & Jingle, with Java being on top and Jingle being on bottom.

```java
// Hello World in Java
public class HelloWorld {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello, World");
  }
  
}
```
`say "Hello World"`

As you can see, Jingle is a lot simpler and in this case, just makes more sense. Its syntax is more similar to scripting languages and lines that you would enter into a command prompt, rather than convoluted solutions to incredibly simple tasks.
