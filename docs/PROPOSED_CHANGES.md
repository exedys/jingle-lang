Proposed changes to the language:

- Delimit blocks with colons (python) and 'end' (ruby) keywords
- Retain var, const and let declaration keywords
- Encourage 3 main paradigms: object-oriented, functional, imperative
- Replace comment styles:
  - Single-line comments replace `//` with `#`
  - Block comments change to `--` to open and close but also keep `/* */`
