## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Jingle is a (very) high-level general-purpose programming language based off of Java. It is statically-typed, inferred and nominal. "So why would I use this instead of Java?", I hear you ask. Well, Jingle is written in almost plain English. This makes it much easier for beginners without adding complexity or removing functionality for advanced programmers. It is also targets the JVM.

## üìî Examples <a name = "examples"></a>
Alright, let's look at how this whole "written in English" thing works. Here are 2 Hello World applications written in both Java & Jingle, with Java being on top and Jingle being on bottom.

```java

public class HelloWorld {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello, World");
  }
  
}
```
`say "Hello World"`

As you can see, Jingle is a lot simpler and in this case, just makes more sense. Its syntax is more similar to scripting languages and lines that you would enter into a command prompt, rather than convoluted solutions to incredibly simple tasks.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Add notes about how to use the system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
